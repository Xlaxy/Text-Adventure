# Text-Adventure

This is a text adventure game made in C++

It took me about 15 minutes to find out how to implement the code and to actually implement the code.

I did this in my fourth week of learning C++ as something to pass the time and for fun.

Feel free to edit the code.

I used Notepad++ to edit the code and Visual Studio 2015 Pre to compile it.
